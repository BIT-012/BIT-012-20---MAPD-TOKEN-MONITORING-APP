Token Monitoring app offers users of prepaid electricity meters(ESCOM Malawi) real-time monitoring of their token balance and allows them to remotely recharge when needed. The app sends a series of notifications when the electricity token balance is running low, ensuring users are always aware of their electricity usage. It also allows users to connect to mobile money or banking apps and recharge from anywhere. The app automatically reads and submits the token number to the corresponding prepaid meter after purchase. It also provides access to other functionalities such as schedules for power outages, messages and updates from ESCOM and viewing of transaction history. This app will remove the hassle of having to go to the neighbours house to recharge when units are completely out or having to contact whoever is home and send them the token so they manually input the 20 digit token number.
